Phases of the Moon

This program computes the dates and times of a list of primary moon phases. The user may specify either the starting date for the list and the number of phases calculated, or a calendar year for all phases during that year. The data can be generated for any year between 1700 and 2100 (inclusive). The program returns the data in JavaScript Object Notation format (or JSON), which can be decoded and reformatted. More information about this application may be found here.

The template URL for querying this service is

For date and number of phases:
https://api.usno.navy.mil/moon/phase?date=DATE&nump=NUMP

For calendar year:
https://api.usno.navy.mil/moon/phase?year=YEAR

The date parameter is described above. The parameter NUMP specifies the number of primary phases that the user wants, starting from the specified date. It is limited to a number between 1 and 99.

Example: query server for 48 primary phases (12 lunar phase cycles) starting from May 3, 2009.
https://api.usno.navy.mil/moon/phase?date=5/3/2009&nump=48

Example: query server for 4 primary phases (1 lunar phase cycle) starting from September 18, 1950.
https://api.usno.navy.mil/moon/phase?date=9/18/1950&nump=4

JSON Notes:

    The first items in the JSON contain the following header information:
        "error" — true if the computation didn't run correctly, false otherwise
        "type" — error type (only present if "error" = true, no other data will be given)
        "apiversion" — the API version used to generate the JSON data
        "year" — the starting year input
        "month" — the starting month input
        "day" — the starting day input
        "numphases" — the number of phases requested
        "datechanged" — true if an invalid date was requested and the program defaulted to today's date, false otherwise
    A list of the phases in follows the header information in "phasedata." Each entry in "phasedata" contains three pieces of data
        "phase" — name of the phase
        "date" — date of the phase (YYYY MMM DD)
        "time" — time of the phase (in UT1)
